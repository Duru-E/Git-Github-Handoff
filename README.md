## CI/CD connection

# Basics

## Git

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS). This provides many features such as to track the contribution and code changes of multiple collaborators, allow rollbacks to earlier version and view history, and also work from a local environment with an easy connection to the remote repository. Most of our work will be directly involved with Git.
[Git Official DOCS](https://git-scm.com/docs)  
## GitHub

GitHub is a server where remote Git repositories are stored. It connects developers to a cloud repository regardless of timezone and distance.
